# Procedure


1. Fix the airfoil in the wind tunnel with leading edge facing the flow and ensure α = 0<sup>o</sup>>.

2. Connect the reference port of the DSA3217 to the pressure port at the inlet of test section.

3. Connect a port on DSA3217 with the airfoil pressure port using pneumatic tube. The reading at the connected port is now (P<sub>x</sub>- P<sub>∞</sub>).

4. Connect a port on DSA3217 with the pressure port at the settling chamber using pneumatic tube. The reading at the connected port is now  (P<sub>0</sub>- P<sub>∞</sub>).

5. Zero calibrate the transducer, i.e., check the output is zero in no flow condition.

6. Set a desired velocity in the wind tunnel using VFD.

7. Take the pressure measurements at different intervals of 5<sup>o</sup> by rotating the airfoil.

8. The experiment can be repeated for different velocity to get readings for different Reynolds number.

9. Tabulate all the data and calculate Cp and CL using the equations.

    ### Calculations

    - From eq. (3) determine the experimental Coefficient of pressure, may call it as experimental value

    - From eq. (4), determine the lift coefficient.

10. Plot graph for Coefficient of pressure for different values of angle of attack

11. Plot the graph for Coefficient of lift versus angle of attack.
